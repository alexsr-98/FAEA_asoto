# FAEA-PL

Simple code to process and plot small sets of data or simulations using ROOT. This repository contains the MC & data rootfiles inside the files folder. In addition, it presents the following Python files.

  * Selector.py declares the homonim class that allows to select events from rootfiles and fill histograms.
  * Plotter.py declares the homonim class that allows to plot histograms and perform selections using Selector objects.
  * test.py shows a simple example of how these classes can be used to plot two distributions and show through terminal the event counting.
